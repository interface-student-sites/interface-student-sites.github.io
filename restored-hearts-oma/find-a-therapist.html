         <p>Your prospective counselor should:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Never minimize your experiences or your pain.</li>
                    <li>Be knowledgeable about the healing process for adults who were sexually abused as children.</li>
                    <li>Keep the focus on you, not on your abuser.</li>
                    <li>Give you room to explore your own history without trying to define it for you.</li>
                    <li>Push you to reconcile with or forgive the abuser.</li>
                    <li>Talk about his or her personal problems.</li>
                    <li>Be sexual with you, now or ever in the future.</li>
                    <li>Respect all of your feelings.</li>
                    <li>Force you to do anything you don't want to do.</li>
                    <li>Encourage you to build a support system outside of therapy.</li>
                    <li>Teach you skills for taking care of yourself.</li>

         <button class="accordion"><h2 align="center">Questions to Ask</h2></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <ul>
                    <li>Are you a licensed psychologist? If they say that they are, look up their license and make sure. There are people who don't have a license and they are practicing. Don't trust someone who would work outside of the law. Once you are sure that they actually have a license, look on the state licensing boards to see if there are any infractions against their license.</li>
                    <li>How many years have you been practicing psychology?</li>
                    <li>I have been feeling (anxious, tense, depressed, etc.) and I'm having problems (with my job, my marriage, eating, sleeping, childhood sexual abuse, etc.). What experience do you have helping people with these types of problems?</li>
                    <li>What are your areas of expertise — for example, working with children and families, trauma, eating disorders, etc? Confirm the therapist has significant education and experience in sexual abuse and trauma. Be wary of people who specialize in EVERYTHING. One can't be all things to all people.</li>
                    <li>Have they worked with people with your issues? Share a little on the phone about your presenting issue and see how the therapist responds.</li>
                    <li>What kinds of treatments do you use, and have they been proven effective for dealing with my kind of problem or issue?</li>
                    <li>What are your fees? (Fees are usually based on a 45-minute to 50-minute session.) Do you have a sliding-scale fee policy?</li>
                    <li>What types of insurance do you accept? Will you accept direct billing to or payment from my insurance company? Are you affiliated with any managed care organizations?
                    <li>Do you accept Medicare or Medicaid insurance?</li>
                    <li>Where did you go to school? The best schools don't necessarily make for the best therapists. When asking this, you're not looking for a certain answer. You just want to know for sure that it is an accredited school and not an online coaching certificate.</li>
                    <li>What is your training? If they say they are trained, find out if it was a one day seminar in EMDR and/or if they took a three-hour online course in psychoanalysis - if they call themselves an expert in a modality after such a short training, hang up and move on to someone with a little more experience.</li>
                    <li>Are you now or have you ever been in therapy? This is a BIG one. Seriously, do not, repeat do not, get into therapy with someone who hasn't done their own work.</li>
